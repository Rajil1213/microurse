# Microurse

This repository includes projects built during the Microservices Course by Stephen Grider on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-node-js-and-react/). While the original course uses NodeJS and React for its projects, this repository will have their equivalent architecture and functionality in Rust and Svelte.
