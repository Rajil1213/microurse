# Microurse

This repository includes projects built during the Microservices Course by Stephen Grider on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-node-js-and-react/). The first sample project is in a separate `blog` branch. The `main` branch contains the main ticketing application Ã  la [StubHub](https://www.stubhub.com/).

However, the stack will be different than the one in the original course, with the following changes:

* Backend: ~`NodeJS (Express)`~ `Rust (Axum)`
* Frontend: ~`NextJS`~ `NuxtJS`
* Database: ~`MongoDB`~ `SurrealDB` (planned)
* Deployment: ~`Google Cloud Platform`~ `AWS` (planned)
